## 🧠 Team & Approach
Team Approach
At AgriTechHub, we adopted a collaborative, cross-functional approach from day one.
Each team member brought unique strengths — from blockchain development and AI integration to UI/UX design and data engineering. We worked in parallel streams to rapidly build, test, and integrate each module.
We emphasized user-first design, constantly validating decisions based on the needs of rural farmers. Agile standups, real-time code sharing, and fast iteration cycles helped us stay aligned, efficient, and focused on delivering a complete, impactful solution within the hackathon timeline.


### Team Name:  
Innovisions

### Team Members:  
- Dhiroj Nayak (Leader/Backend dev/AI Dev)
- Aditya Kumar Sahoo (UI & UX/ Frontend Dev)

### Your Approach:  
Why we chose this problem:
We recognized that millions of farmers lack access to fair markets, financial services, and reliable information. We chose this problem to bridge that gap using blockchain, AI, and real-time data — empowering farmers with tools typically reserved for big enterprises.

Key challenges we addressed:
We tackled challenges like low internet connectivity, the complexity of blockchain for non-technical users, real-time data synchronization, and building a voice-accessible, mobile-first platform for rural areas.

Pivots, brainstorms, and breakthroughs:
During development, we pivoted from a traditional app model to a decentralized, lightweight web platform to better suit farmer needs. A major breakthrough was integrating Stellar for frictionless micro-transactions and using Alan AI for multi-language voice support, making the platform accessible to digitally underserved communities.
